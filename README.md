## Task A
Initially, I started the HTML with static code in terms of the items and then moved all of that code into JS where I decided to create
an onload event. In terms of CSS, I had some difficulties as for example the top of the page was not a navigation bar which I am used to making,but it was exciting to find another way to make the page look presentable. The only styling I was not able to complete was the cutting
of the edge of the border of the price, which I have commented out in my CSS file.

## Task B
Due to not having much experience with CSS and Responsiveness, I did my best making the site responsive for Iphones and had the rest of the
code be the same for any other width. I would hope if my project is good enough to qualify me for the next stage, to have enough support to 
learn how to use CSS and Angular in a better way.

## Task C1 (UI Design)

N/A

## Task C2 (JavaScript)
Initially I was caught by suprise that the script file was placed in the head section, but after realising I placed it in in the bottom of
the body tag. I started off with the idea of creating different buttons on each item in order to open the modal. However, afterwards
decided to build it more dynamically and have an onclick event each time an item was clicked. I did not manage to finish the full modal and
display the rest of the information but was happy that it works for the time I had. I also made the code more adaptive and responsive,
in case more fruits would be added, there would be one big object that can store them. 

Thank you for the well made instructions and taking the time to review my work.
